Tilt-Cruncher
=============

Tilt-Cruncher is a processing module for the TiLT Demo.  It is a very simple example of a microservice
that would handle processing of data generated by other services.   It also provides a basic REST API
to ease graphic of this data through other visualization means.


*Note*

It is strongly recommended to only run ONE instance of tilt-cruncher as it doesn't do any type of locking
on the data and when there are multiple tilt server instances running you may get grossly inaccurate data
